This project has been exceedingly difficult.  I have not found anyone to help me
so far.  A few have stepped forward, but to date there has not been one line of
source code that has been contributed by another soul.

Even with all of this upon my shoulders, I have such amazing peace in my heart.
I have a sense of the long distance runner in the middle of the race, settled in
for the long haul, having gotten my second wind.

I am thankful unto my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, for bringing me this far.
There has been nothing about this project that has been easy, but there when I
have felt week, or troubled, my Lord has always been there and I have come through
in faith, in seeking a closer relationship with Him.  And, that being far more
important than anything I could hope to complete on this project, I consider it
already to be an outstanding success.

May the Lord bless you richly in your pursuit of Him with everything in your life.
I pray that He will continually grow your efforts in serving Him, and reaching
others, throughout the remainder of your days, until He calls you Home.  Amen.

Happiness.  Joy.  Amazing Love.  The Lord's domain.

Best regards,
Rick C. Hodgin

Update:  I've continued to be sick off and on.  And I've had pain in my eyes at
the end of each development day.  It is most definitely exhaustion from working
on this project.

However, I do indeed remain happy despite my oft illnesses and pain. :-)

Happy happy. :-)  If you haven't seen "DNA Project Butterfly," you might
find it interesting.  It occurred to me one day when I was looking at
the pattern on a butterfly's wing.  It looked amazingly like the 3D UV-
unwrapped texture data seen in projects like those created in Blender.
I had the thought that perhaps that is actually exactly what we are
seeing there in the beautiful patterns, a message from God given to us
in the very DNA of these remarkable creatures, conveying within them by
their very nature the duality of DNA, in that the first DNA creates the
worm/caterpillar portion, and the second DNA creates the beautiful insect
which takes flight, and is adorned with such striking color after a
remarkable transformation, for that would be what would happen here
with our understanding of DNA ... two cycles or phases, the first being
the mechanics necessary to lay the foundation for what will come after,
the truly beautiful thing ... which in this case would be the Revelation
(with a capital R) given to mankind by God, in the very substrate of the
encoding used to create all life, that embedded within that which our
best scientists until recently have considered to be "Junk DNA," that
this very DNA contains a 3D encoding describing a message from God to
man ... directly, and without question, as it such a message would be
written into the very heart of that which all of us are directly
comprised of.

It should prove to be an interesting journey in discovery and faith.  Won't
you come along and help uncover this potential mystery found in the DNA

Read about what I believe will be the first message we'll see:
the Monarch Candle:  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dnaprojectbutterfly/e8P5t2_1hc0

The Monarch Butterfly was the first butterfly genome sequenced:
(v3 scaffolds) http://monarchbase.umassmed.edu/resource.html
(Monarch image) http://www.truechristianity.info/img/god_has_created_this/big/butterfly_wikimedia_0067_big.jpg

Look closely, and you can see that which surprised me:  The appearance
of something like a candle in the wings.  I had the idea that this goes
along with Genesis 1:3 -- "And God said, Let there be light: and there was
light," (http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-3.htm).

The Monarch Candle, the King's Light, will be our guide.

Happy?  Oh yeah! :-)
