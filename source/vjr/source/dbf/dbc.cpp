// It is our request that you maintain it that way.  This is not a legal request unto
// our court systems, but rather a personal matter between you and God.  Our talents
// were received from God, and given to you through this forum.  And it is our wish
// that those talents reach out to as many as possible in a form allowing them to wield
// this content for their own betterment, as you are now considering doing.  And whereas
// we could've forced the issue through something like a copyleft-protected release, the
// truth is we are all giving an account of our lives unto God continually by the daily
// choices we make.  And here again is another case where you get to demonstrate your
// character unto God, and unto your fellow man.
//
// Jesus came to this Earth to set the captives free, to save men's eternal souls from
// the punishment demanded by our sin.  Each one of us is given the opportunity to
// receive Him in this world and be saved.  Whether we choose to receive Him, and follow
// Him, and purpose our lives on the goals He has for each of us (all of which are
// beneficial for all involved), is one way we reveal our character continually.  God
// sees straight through to the heart, bypassing all of the words, all of the facades.
// He is our Creator, and He knows who we are truly.
//
// Jesus is called "Christ" because He saves men from the eternal flames of Hell, the
// just punishment of rebellion against God (rebellion against truth) by eternal beings,
// which each of us are.
//
// Do not let His free gift escape you because of some desire to shortcut what is right
// in your life. Instead, do what is right, and do it because He is who He is, and what
// He has done to save us from such a fate.  Demonstrate to Him, to me, and to all of
// mankind, and to all of the Heavenly hosts, exactly who you are on the inside.  Receive
// Jesus Christ into your heart, learn of Him, of how He came here to guide us into that
// which is of His Kingdom and will be forever hereafter we leave this world.  Do this,
// and live.
