Oppie (or "Little Opcode") plans to be (James 4:15, Lord willing), a
series of mini-CPUs that perform various functions approaching a real
CPU.

Oppie-1 -- (in progress) A simple 8-bit CPU with eight opcodes, 2 KB of
		RAM, four 8-bit registers, built atop a 3-, 4-, or 5-stage
		pipeline (read instruction, decode, [read data], execute,
		[write retire] -- pipe stages in [brackets] are optional
		per instruction).

Oppie-2 -- (planned) An extension of Oppie-1 supporting more instructions,
		eight 32-bit registers and full 32-bit unsigned integer
		processing and instructions, a stack, tasks, and selectors.

Oppie-3 -- (planned) A near i386 compatible machine, but with many
		planned LibSF 386-x40 features.

Oppie-4 -- (planned) A dual-core Oppie-3.

Oppie-5 -- (planned) A full LibSF 386-x40 core.
		
Oppie-6 -- (planned) A Love Threading Oppie-5.

Oppie-7 -- (planned) A dual-core Oppie-6.

-----
The final goal is the basic framework necessary to bring the
"LibSF 386-x40" to life (hereafter called li386 for short).

The li386 architecture defines:

	(1)  Only protected-mode operations.
	(2)  32-bit or 40-bit processing.
	(3)  FPU and SIMD as first-class citizens, no FPU stack in li386 mode.
	(4)  Two cores, each with Love Threading (two tightly coupled threads).
	(5)  1TB of addressable memory per core.
	(6)  1TB of addressable memory shared in common (5TB total).
	(7)  Support for multiple ISAs, including:
		(a) li386 (LibSF's revamp of the i386 opcodes)
		(b) liARM (a large subset of ARMv7's 32-bit ISA)
		(c) i386 ISAs (80386 opcodes with some newer features
			added bringing it closer to i686)

All of this is James 4:15, which is to say, "Lord willing," for it is
not by me, but by Him, if it is to be. :-)
