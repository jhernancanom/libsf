Lin2Win X-windows Support
-------------------------

The Liberty Software Foundation (LibSF) Lin2Win project is a Linux-to-Windows
emulation layer allowing source code written to run natively in Windows 98 and
later to operate in a Unix-like OS running X-windows.

32-bit and 64-bit support is provided.

-----
As of Feb.12.2015 it is about 40% complete with regards to the needs of the
Visual FreePro, Jr. project.  Visual FreePro, Jr. requires only a small
portion of the overall Windows API.

Additional development can be added to fill in any missing functionality for
those wishing to use the software in their Windows-based application.

Best regards,
Rick C. Hodgin
