Liberty Software "LibSF" 386-x40 CPU Project
Mar.09.2015 -- Partially designed, not yet coded

Summary:
A 40-bit extension of the 80386 with much ISA revamping.
Provides 100% backward compatibility with all aspects of
the non-kernel ISA and structures, with the exception of
paging.

Milestones:
Oppie-1 through Oppie-7 have been mapped out.
Oppie-1 has been coded, including emulator, assembler, debugger, and verilog.
LibSF-386-x40 fundamental design has been created.  See the li386-documentation pages.

As of Feb.20.2013, it contains The Visual FreePro Project,
which is comprised of several sub-components:

(1) VVM    - The Visual FreePro Virtual Machine top-level program.
(2) OSS    - The VVM Operating System Specific code.
(3) MC     - The VVM Machine Code assembler, disassembler for debugger.
(4) VASM   - The VVM source code assembler.
(5) VDeb   - The VVM Debugger (a compiled DLL).
(6) VDebugLauncher - The VVM Debugger launcher (tells VVM to load the debugger DLL).
